# Biophysics, biochemistry and bioinformatics portfolio
In this repository I'll be including projects related to biophysics, biochemistry and bioinformatics that I've been doing during my academic years and serve as an overview of my general knowledge. Areas in which this work is divided are:
  * **Biological systems modeling**
  * **NGS RNA-seq data analysis** with R package Bioconductor 
  * A **protein mining** project with Biopython (Master's dissertation)
  * A drug discovery project with **Molecular docking and activity assays**
  * Systems biology projects **modeling intracellular processes**
  * **Instrumental techniques** data analysis involving:
      * Spectroscopy
      * Cellular nuclei marking and visualization
      * Small-molecules screening
      * Organic synthesis (Final degree project)
